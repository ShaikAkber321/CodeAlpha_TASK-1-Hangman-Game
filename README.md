## Overview of the Project

### Project: Text-based Hangman Game

### Objective
The objective of this project is a **Text-based Hangman game** where the player guesses a hidden word letter by letter, with a limit of 6 incorrect attempts. Built with Python for beginners to understand core programming concepts.  

### Key Features  
- **Predefined Word Bank**: 5 common words randomly selected.  
- **Guess Tracking**: Limits to 6 incorrect guesses (classic Hangman rules).  
- **Interactive Console**: Simple input/output with real-time feedback.  
- **Win/Lose Logic**: Clear messages for game outcomes.  

### Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.  
- **Random Module**: Selects a random word from the predefined list.  
- **Basic I/O**: Uses `input()` and `print()` for user interaction.

### Key Insights

- **Control Flow**: Demonstrates `while` loops and `if-else` logic for game progression.
- **String Manipulation**: Replaces underscores (`_`) with correctly guessed letters.  
- **List Operations**: Tracks guessed letters to avoid repeats.  
- **Error Handling**: Validates user input (single alphabetic characters only).

### How to Run  
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.  
2. Download/Copy the `hangman.py` script.  
3. Run in terminal:  
   ```bash  
   python hangman.py
